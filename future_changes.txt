Future changes:

Allow the use of "#" for comments

Eventually, get incorrect syntaxes to not assemble, as they may affect the correctness of assembly. For ex. on a branch instruction, an improper label may count as a line of code and give the wrong offset. Stop assembly at exactly the point where error occurs.

Allow for output in hex as well.

Save the binary outputs in lists, so that binary and hex can be toggled.

Possible allow for hex or binary input.
